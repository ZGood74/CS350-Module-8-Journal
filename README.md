Summary of the Projects and Their Problems
The Thermostat Project focused on developing a smart thermostat prototype using a Raspberry Pi, a temperature sensor, LEDs, and buttons to simulate real-world heating and cooling control. The system read temperature data, displayed it on an LCD, and sent it via UART to simulate server communication. This project tackled the challenge of integrating hardware and software to create a functional and adaptable temperature control system.

The Milestone Three Project involved using LEDs to flash Morse code messages, changing patterns based on button inputs. The challenge was implementing a state machine to handle message transitions while ensuring smooth execution. The project also integrated a 16x2 LCD display to provide real-time feedback, reinforcing key concepts in embedded systems programming and event-driven state transitions.

What Did I Do Well?
In the Thermostat Project, I successfully implemented GPIO control for LEDs and buttons, enabling user interaction with the system. The project demonstrated strong I2C communication by accurately reading temperature sensor data and displaying it on an LCD screen.
In Milestone Three, I effectively implemented a state machine to transition Morse code messages based on button presses. The code handled interrupt-based inputs without disrupting message timing.
Where Could I Improve?
In the Thermostat Project, refining error handling and exception management would improve the systemâ€™s reliability. Adding Wi-Fi connectivity instead of UART for data transmission would also be a valuable enhancement.
In Milestone Three, optimizing LED timing precision and expanding the Morse code logic for custom messages would improve functionality. Additionally, adding an intuitive user interface on the LCD would enhance usability.
What Tools and Resources Am I Adding to My Support Network?
GitHub for version control and portfolio-building.
Raspberry Pi GPIOZero & I2C libraries for embedded systems programming.
State machine concepts to improve structured program execution.
UART & Serial Communication tools for real-world IoT applications.
What Skills Are Transferable to Other Projects?
Hardware-Software Integration: Understanding how to interface sensors, LEDs, and displays using Raspberry Pi.
State Machine Implementation: Essential for any embedded system that requires structured event transitions.
I2C & UART Communication: Useful in IoT, robotics, and real-time monitoring systems.
Interrupt Handling: Valuable in any application where external user inputs control device behavior.
How Did I Make This Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?
Modular Code Design: Each function was structured to perform a specific task (e.g., reading temperature, updating the LCD, processing button inputs).
Commenting & Documentation: Included detailed comments to improve readability.
Error Handling: Implemented exception handling to prevent crashes.
Scalability: Both projects allow future expansion, such as adding Wi-Fi capabilities in the Thermostat Project or custom Morse code input in Milestone Three.
